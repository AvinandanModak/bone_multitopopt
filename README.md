## Abstract
Bone exhibits a hierarchical organization across multiple length scales, integrating functional properties through adaptive remodeling mechanisms. In this article, we present a concurrent material-structure optimization framework that identifies optimal macroscale bone density and microstructural configurations, including collagen and hydroxyapatite distribution and lacunae orientation, across the length scales in bone's hierarchical organization. Our framework formulates a compliance minimization problem with coupled material and structure optimization sub-problems and leverages a continuum micromechanics-based homogenization approach to efficiently capture bone’s hierarchical material behavior. This approach enables computationally tractable optimization independent of the number of hierarchical scales, overcoming limitations of conventional remodeling approaches. We apply our framework to a human proximal femur subjected to realistic musculoskeletal loading conditions, demonstrating its capability to capture naturally occuring self-optimizing mechanisms. The optimized hierarchical organization aligns with patient-specific CT-derived bone composition, providing a quantitative basis for assessing deficiencies in collagen and mineral fractions. These findings open pathways for targeted therapeutic strategies, personalized bone diagnostics, and regenerative medicine applications.
